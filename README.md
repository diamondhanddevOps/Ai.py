# Ai.py

The code is a script written in Python, which automates a process that scrapes data from a website, saves it to a CSV file, and trains a machine learning model on the scraped data.

The script uses the requests library to make a request to the website, and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content of the page. The data you want to scrape is located in <div> elements with a specific class name, and you extract the title and description of each item using the find() method.

The scraped data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional size-mutable, heterogeneous tabular data structure. You can save the data to a CSV file using the to_csv() method.

Next, you prepare the data for training by selecting the columns you want to use as the features and the target. You split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function, and train a Random Forest Classifier using the RandomForestClassifier class.

Finally, you evaluate the model on the test data, and print out its accuracy. The accuracy is a measure of how well the model predicts the target values based on the features.
